## bToggler
### 8 buffered toggle switch signal router
#### - Description:
'bToggler' can be used to mute/unmute up to 8 CVs or AUDIO signals, in sync to a tempo clock source.  
For example it can be used to play/stop drumkit parts independently (kick, snare, hats, etc):
- connect an appropriate clock source to CLOCK 
- connect the ARMs to a "MIDI>GATE" module which receives controls from a midi controller
- connect the INs to the single sequencers outs, one for kick, one for snare, etc.
- connect the OUTs to the trigger inputs of the single drum modules

Then, by pressing buttons on the controller, 'bToggler' will actually start/stop the single drum parts on the next received clock pulse.

Otherwise bToggler OUTs can be connected to envelope generators. In that case the GATE output should be connected to the IN input to activate the envelope.

'bToggler' can also be used to play audio signals directly. Connect IN to the audio source and OUT to mixer: the FADE knob will avoid clicks.
#### - Detailed instructions:
Connect a clock source.

When ARM input is triggered (arm on) the IN input will start to be routed to OUT on next clock detection and GATE output will provide a high state.

Then, with another ARM triggering (arm off) the routing will stop on next clock detection and GATE output will go low.

FADE knob (up to 50ms) can be used to avoid attack or release clicks when audio signals are connected to IN input.

If ARM is triggered again before clock detection it will abort arming (unarm).

Triggering RESET input will immediately stop the routing.

Triggering RESETALL input will immediately stop all the 8 routings.

NOTE: input triggers are considered high when greater than 0v.
 
## bToggler+
### 8 buffered toggle switch router, plus warnings to use with led midi controllers
#### - Description:
'bToggler+' is almost the same of previous one, but it has a further feature (WRN outs) to be used with programmable led midi controllers to have a visual feedback on the controller.

Some midi controllers can light up or turn off their button leds by receiving the same commands they send.  
Taking advantage of this functionality, connect the WRN outs to a "GATE>MIDI" module connected to the same controller of the ARM inputs.  
So when pressing buttons on controller, 'bToggler+' will actually play/stop the sequencers or audio, and simultaneously give a visual feedback on the controller.
#### - Detailed instructions:
The same of the previous one, plus:

When 'armed on' or 'armed off', the WRN (warning) output will provide a sequence of pulses until next clock is detected.  
Then it will act as the OUT output (the routed signal) if the FADE knob is set to 0ms, else it will act as the GATE output (high gate).  
This is because if 'bToggler+' is receiving signals from sequencers, the FADE knob will be set to 0 and the led will light up the same as sequencers trigs.  
Otherwise, if fade knob is set different from 0, it is supposed that an audio signal is routed, so you'll see a fixed led light on the controller.

WA and WR knobs set the attack (arm on) and release (arm off) pulserate up to 200 ms of the warning pulses. These are two independent settings because you would like to notice if the routing is going to start or stop.

If WA or WR are set to 0ms, WRN will output a low gate during warning time and if set to to max (200ms) it will output a high gate.  
As to say: if WA is set to 0 and WR is set to max(200), WRN output will act like the GATE output.  
Otherwise if WA is set to max(200) and WR is set to 0, WRN output will act as simple toggle switch with no buffer feature.

NOTE: input triggers are considered high when greater than 0v.

## Calcs
### Calculates sums, differences, multiplications, divisions and averages of 3 CV inputs
#### - Instructions:
A, B and C are the inputs. The output tables provide simple math calculations and averages between two inputs or the average of all of them.

U/B (Unipolar/Bipolar) switch clamps the outputs to 0/10V or -5/+5v.

## Toggler / Toggler Compact
### Stereo signal toggle switch router, with VCA and ASR envelope generator, in regular and compact form factor
#### - Description:
- Toggled VCA with builtin ASR envelope generator
- Toggled ASR envelope generator
- mute/unmute CVs or mono/stereo AUDIO signals according to an ASR envelope activated by a Gate or Toggle Triggers
#### - Detailed instructions:
**TOGGLE MODE**

On receiving a trigger on TRIG input, it will send the L+(R) inputs to L+(R) outputs and set the GATE output to high. On next trigger it will interrupt L+(R) outputs and set the GATE output to low.

Attack, Sustain and Release knobs set the envelope of the routed signal.

A, S, R CVinputs are added to respective knob values.

If L or (R) inputs are not connected, L and (R) outputs will provide just the envelope, so a mono signal can be connected to L input to route it to L output and nothing connected to (R) input to have the envelope on (R) output.

A trigger on RESET input will reset the toggle state.

**GATE MODE**

The same of toggle mode, but the signals will be routed only while GATE input is in a high state.

NOTE: input triggers or gates are considered high when greater than 0v.

NOTE: If a new GATE or Toggle TRIGGER is detected on Attack or Release phases, the envelope ramp will immediately restart from the reached point, as a regular envelope generator and not like a function generator.

**SPECIAL BEHAVIORS**

If Attack is set to 0 (and release is set greater than 0) and a new GATE or Toggle TRIGGER is detected before Release phase has ended, the next Release phase will start from the previous reached release point.

If Release is set to 0 (and attack is set greater than 0) and a new GATE or Toggle TRIGGER is detected before Attack phase has ended, the next Attack phase will start from the previous reached Attack point.

These behaviors are more understandable connecting a scope on the output.

## bTogglerSt / bTogglerSt Compact
### Buffered stereo signal toggle switch router, with VCA and ASR envelope generator, in regular and compact form factor
#### - Description:
- Buffered Toggled VCA with builtin ASR envelope generator
- Buffered Toggled ASR envelope generator
- Buffer mute/unmute CVs or mono/stereo AUDIO signals according to an ASR envelope activated by Toggle Triggers

bTogglerSt is actually a mixture of Toggler and bToggler, the purposes remain the same.
#### - Detailed instructions:
Connect a clock source.

When ARM input is triggered (arm on), the L+(R) inputs will start to be routed to L+(R) outputs on next clock detection (according to ASR envelope values) and GATE output will provide a high state.

Then, with another ARM triggering (arm off) the routing will stop on next clock detection and GATE output will go low.

If ARM is triggered again before clock detection it will abort arming (unarm).

Attack, Sustain and Release knobs set the envelope of the routed signals.

A, S, R CVinputs are added to respective knob values.

If L or (R) inputs are not connected, L and (R) outputs will provide just the envelope, so a mono signal can be connected to L input to route it to L output and nothing connected to (R) input to have the envelope on (R) output.

A trigger on RESET input will reset the toggle state.

NOTE: input triggers are considered high when greater than 0v.
